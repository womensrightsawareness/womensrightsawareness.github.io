        <h1> Women's Rights </h1>
        <p id="introQuote">"  I recognize no rights but human rights — I know nothing of men's rights and women's rights  "</p>
        <p class="introTxt"><em>- Angelina Grimké</em></p>
        <p class="introTxt">Women’s rights are also human rights. Every human is entitled to freedom of opinion and expression, the right to work, and the right to education, etc. However, these rights are not always respected. And this is most apparent with women, who, in many societies are discriminated against on the basis of gender. Every human is equal. No matter their religion, gender, race, etc. We tried to learn about the opinions and perspectives on the topic of a diverse range of people, from high school students to adults and experts.</p>

            <p class="Analysis">We had highschool students fill out a survey we prepared which had some general questions. We had both male and female students fill it to see what both of them think of the topic. There were quite a few differences in the general response from both. Such as, in Q5, around 20% more girls than boys answered that women’s rights were a major issue. There is also a difference of views in Q7, where most boys answered that women should not have the right to abortion, whereas most girls stayed neutral on the topic.</p>
