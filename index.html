        <p id="introQuote">"  I recognize no rights but human rights — I know nothing of men's rights and women's rights  "</p>
        <p class="introTxt"> - Angelina Grimké</p>
        <p class="introTxt">Women’s rights are also human rights. Every human is entitled to freedom of opinion and expression, the right to work, and the right to education, etc. However, these rights are not always respected. And this is most apparent with women, who, in many societies are discriminated against on the basis of gender. Every human is equal. No matter their religion, gender, race, etc. We tried to learn about the opinions and perspectives on the topic of a diverse range of people, from high school students to adults and experts.</p>
